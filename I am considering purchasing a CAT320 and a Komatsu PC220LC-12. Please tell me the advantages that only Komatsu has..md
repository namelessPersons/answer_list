## Intelligent Control Technology

- **2D Boundary Control (Komatsu PC220LCi-12):**  
  Allows operators to set virtual boundaries, preventing the boom or bucket from swinging into restricted zones and increasing jobsite safety. Especially useful for avoiding contact with workers or obstacles.  
  *Reference: PC220LCi-12-cs_page_14.pdf*

- **2D Machine Control:**  
  Prevents over-digging and assists precise grading by automatically stopping excavation at set depths or slopes.  
  *Reference: PC220LCi-12-cs_page_14.pdf*

- **Payload Meter:**  
  Real-time display of bucket and total payload for efficient, accurate loading.  
  *Reference: PC220LCi-12-cs_page_14.pdf*

- **Joystick Steering:**  
  Enables travel operations using the equipment's control levers only, reducing reliance on pedals and maximizing operator comfort and flexibility.

## Work Equipment & Structural Enhancements

- **Reinforced Boom and Arm:**  
  Increased thickness of key boom plates (e.g., plate bracket from 28t to 32t, rear side plate from 12t to 14t, lower plate from 14t to 16t) and significantly wider boom top and foot parts—improving durability, longevity, and suitability for tough jobs.  
  *Reference: PC220LC-12_seles_manual_sec111_Other.pdf*

- **Reinforced Castings:**  
  Enhanced castings used in the PC220LC-12 improve resistance to heavy-duty applications.

## Operator Comfort & Premium Cab Environment

- **All-new, Larger Cab:**  
  Up to 30% greater legroom and improved ergonomics—designed for comfort over long hours.  
  *Reference: PC220LCi-12-cs_page_4.pdf*

- **Highly Ergonomic Controls and Touchscreen Interface**  
- **Heated, High-Back Air-Suspended Seat (Standard):**  
  With lumbar support, tilt-up console, and premium seat options.

- **Integrated Automatic Climate Control:**  
  Advanced sound insulation, hot/cool box, USB and power outlets, and wireless remote locking.  
  *Reference: PC220LCi-12-cs_page_30.pdf*

- **Keyless Start and Personalized Operator ID Settings**
