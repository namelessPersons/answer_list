Here are the features and suitable applications of the various blade types/settings available for the Komatsu D155 (specifically the D155AX-8, but generally valid for D155 series):

## Blade Types and Their Features

| Blade Type         | Features/Description                                                                                   | Best Suited For                                                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sigma Dozer Blade  | Patented curved design improves penetration and rolling of material. High efficiency in many soil conditions and reduced material spillage. | General earthmoving, leveling, cutting soft-to-medium ground, side-cutting, moderate travel distances. |
| S-Blade (Straight) | Straight blade with no wings; good for precision leveling and spreading material.                     | Fine grading, short carry distances, hard material digging, shaping slopes. |
| Semi-U Blade       | Slightly curved with small wings; balances penetration and carrying capability.                       | General dozing, medium-long carries, stockpile management.             |
| Full-U Blade       | Deeply curved with large wings; highest capacity for moving large volumes over long distances.         | Bulk earthmoving, long haul, handling lighter materials, soft soils.   |
| Super Dozer Blade  | Specialized large-capacity blade for maximum productivity.                                            | Wide areas, loose to medium soils, long-distance transport within work site. |

## Additional Features

- **Angle/Pitch Adjustment:** The blade angle can usually be adjusted to optimize penetration efficiency and surface finish.
- **Easy Operation:** Modern D155 models offer hydraulic and electronic controls for blade pitch, tilt, and lift.
- **Strength and Durability:** Blades are designed with reinforced materials for high wear resistance.
- **Quick Attach/Detachment:** Maintenance and blade change can be done efficiently, as detailed in shop manuals.
