## Key Differences: PC1250 Standard vs SE Models

| Item | PC1250-11R Standard/土木仕様 | PC1250-11R SE仕様 (Special Equipment) |
|---|---|---|
| **Intended Application** | General earthwork, mixed tasks | High-volume loading of loose or blasted rock in quarry/mining (専用積込向き) |
| **Machine Weight** | 116.6–118.0 t (Earthwork, Rock spec.) | 119.0 t |
| **Boom Length** | 9.1 m | 7.8 m (shorter, stronger) |
| **Arm Length** | 3.4 m | 3.4 m (reinforced) |
| **Bucket Capacity** | 5.0 m³ (Earthwork) / 5.2 m³ (Rock) | 6.7 m³ (reinforced for SE) |
| **Bucket Digging Force** | 479 kN | 570 kN (significantly higher for SE) |
| **Arm Digging Force** | 412 kN | 412 kN |
| **Standard Bucket Shape** | Standard, reinforced (for Rock) | Reinforced, dedicated for high-capacity/loose material |
| **Undercarriage** | Standard/Heavy Duty (depending on spec) | Heavy duty, reinforced |
| **Main Selling Point** | Versatile for digging and loading, tighter spaces, can do some quarry work | Efficient in mass loading operations from lower benches (pile height 3–5 m), emphasizes high productivity and durability |
| **Limitation/Remarks** | More versatile, good for both digging and loading | Not recommended for high bench (deep trench) work due to shorter reach; focus on loading operations from below |

## Application Suitability

- **SE Model:** Best for low-bench (3–5 m) operation, where high volumes of loose or blasted materials need to be loaded rapidly—typical in mining and quarry environments.
- **Standard Model:** More balanced for general construction, including both digging and loading across variable site conditions. Offers longer reach for applications like trench or foundation digging.

## Summary Table: Feature/Spec Highlights

| Feature/Spec | Standard Model | SE Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Versatility** | High | Lower (loading focus) |
| **Loading Productivity** | Standard | Highest |
| **Suitability for Deep Digging** | Better | Limited (shorter boom) |
| **Wear/Durability** | Standard (Earthwork), Reinforced (Rock) | Extra-reinforced for severe sites |
| **Bucket/Arm Structure** | Standard/Reinforced | Strongly reinforced |
| **Optimal Bench Height (loading)** | General | 3–5 meters |
