## Key Points

- **Komatsu iMC 3.0**: Fully integrated, covers all attachments, deeply embedded GNSS and automation for productivity and flexibility.
- **In-Cab Design and Automation**: Allows operators to create and modify designs directly on site for maximum flexibility.
- **Boundary/Safety Automation**: Advanced multi-surface boundary management, automatic stop, and minimum distance controls.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Hidden GNSS, tool-less calibration, and seamless retrofit upgrades.
- **Operator-Focused**: Unique semi-automation, ease-of-use for all operators, and robust assist functions.

*In contrast, while the CAT320 offers operator comfort, E-Fence, GRADE Assist, and PAYLOAD options, its automation and machine control integration are less versatile or deeply embedded than Komatsu’s iMC 3.0 suite, especially for multi-attachment and in-field design.*
