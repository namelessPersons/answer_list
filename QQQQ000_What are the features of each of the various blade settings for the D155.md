Unfortunately, I could not find any information regarding the features of various blade configurations for the D155 bulldozer within the provided PDF documents.

I apologize, but there are no details about the different blade setups for the D155 bulldozer in the materials you shared, so I am unable to provide an answer.

If there is anything else you would like to know or if you need information about a different machine, please let me know.
